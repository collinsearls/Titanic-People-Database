# Titanic People Database

This spreadsheet was originally created for an exhibit I directed at Open Sauce 2025 titled “Would You Have Survived the Titanic?” It served as the backend for calculating survival odds across different age groups, which were then turned into percentages used in one of the tests attendees completed during the exhibit.

Visitors were also given a card featuring a real passenger from the Titanic. One of the sheets in this workbook powered an automated merge in Affinity Publisher, filling each card’s template with the appropriate details.

The final sheet contains work I did to calculate dimensions for a memorial-style display concept that didn’t make it into the exhibit due to time constraints.

Data Notice:

The original version of this spreadsheet used real passenger information that I legally purchased from Encyclopedia Titanica. Because that data is copyrighted and cannot be redistributed, the version included in this portfolio contains fully dummy, non-historical sample data used solely to demonstrate structure and functionality.

Tools Used:

**Google Sheets**

Core formulas: SUM, DIVIDE, COUNTIF

Survival-percentage calculations

Group/classification logic

Sheet organization and data cleaning


**Affinity Publisher**

Auto Merge feature used to generate passenger cards from spreadsheet data

Custom-designed card template

Skills Demonstrated:

This project reflects several analyst-relevant competencies:

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
Organizing mixed historical data into a structured, usable database.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
Breaking down survival rates by age bracket and demographic grouping.

**Statistical Summaries**
Computing percentage-based survival odds using spreadsheet formulas.

**Classification & Categorization**
Sorting passengers into groups for exhibit logic and survival modeling.

**Documentation & Workflow Design**
Developing a clear, multi-sheet file used in an interactive public exhibit.

**Automation for Publishing**
Integrating spreadsheet data with Affinity Publisher to auto-generate attendee cards.

Project Purpose

This spreadsheet wasn’t just a personal exercise — it was a working analytical tool used in a real public-facing experience. It helped determine test outputs, supported automated publishing workflows, and guided design decisions for a large-scale exhibit.
